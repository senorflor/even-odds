# even-odds

"math" in "html"

## What even is this?

It's a Rube Goldberg machine that shows that where there's a will, there's a `way.html`, c.f. https://twitter.com/wahabind/status/1243622427181146116 . Open up [index.html](index.html) to see instructions.

It should probably just be a single page with a bunch of links and two `id`-d elements referred to by `#even` and `#odd` fragments as a minimal proof, but this way the address bar ends up feeling kind of like a weird REPL.

Oh and also I wanted to test [this article which I got an email about](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/25/announcing-faster-deploys-for-large-sites/). The deploy's been running about 40 minutes now :)

Next step: embed [Peano arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms#Arithmetic) in pure HTML. Probably needs something a little richer than `refresh`-based redirect meta tags ðŸ˜†
