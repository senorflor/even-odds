<h2>Instructions (reduced version that will actually deploy on Netlify*)</h2>
<p>To determine whether a number is even or odd (from 0 to <del>65535</del> <ins>3</ins>), simply enter it in your browser as the last part of the URL (preceded by a <code>/</code> if necessary to separate it from the domain) at <a href="https://even-odds.netlify.com" target="_blank">https://even-odds.netlify.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you are running this "project" locally, add a <code>.htm</code> to the end of the number, since you won't have Netlify's routing defaults resolving to htm/html pages for you.</p>

<p>(* Ended up cutting down the implementation and killing the deploy after an hour to be kind to the folks over at Netlify on a Friday night: sincerely hope I didn't jump to the top of any leaderboards or cause any alerts!)</p>
