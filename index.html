<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>To determine whether a number is even or odd (from 0 to 65535), simply enter it in your browser as the last part of the URL (preceded by a <code>/</code> if necessary to separate it from the domain) at <a href="https://even-odds.netlify.com" target="_blank">https://even-odds.netlify.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you are running this "project" locally, add a <code>.htm</code> to the end of the number, since you won't have Netlify's routing defaults resolving to htm/html pages for you.</p>

<p>(You may <em>have</em> to run it locally, because this "website" has been deploying on Netlify for 27 minutes.)</p>
